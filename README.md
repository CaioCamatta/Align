Effortless alerts when your lose good posture.

We used ElectronJS to build a cross platform desktop app that uses your webcam and Google Cloud's Vision recognition AI to periodically analyze your posture. Coupled with an in-house developed algorithm, we are able to recognize when your posture is bad, and then notify you. The user interface was built with HTML and CSS.

We are proud that we were able tackle such a prominent issue through a solution that is very simple to use, and that can actually make a change in the workplace, school and home.
